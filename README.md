| __SPEAKERS EXCERPT:-__ |
| --------- |
| In this session, we would like to share with you, our insights of running Data Science and Machine Learning use cases on Azure Analytics Platform within the business area of Trading & Sales at Axpo. As those use cases are running 24/7, we are striving to write robust and production-ready code, allowing us to react fast and meaningful, based on the most recent market changes. Hence, we are relying heavily on Azure DevOps CI/CD for managing our codebase and deployment pipelines. Together with Cloud Platform Team, we have built a comprehensive set of automated DevOps processes, helping us to reduce the time to market of new ideas and scaling DevOps best practices with the entire organisation. |
